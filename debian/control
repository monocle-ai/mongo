Description: object/document-oriented database (metapackage)
 TokuMX is a high-performance version of MongoDB using Fractal
 Tree indexes to store indexes and data.  TokuMX is
 driver-compatible with MongoDB and has the same simple
 management and operations interface as MongoDB, and adds:
 .
    * Much higher performance on out-of-memory write workloads.
    * Compression of all data, up to 10x in many cases.
    * Document-level concurrency for all read and write
      operations.
    * Transactional semantics including snapshot reads and
      multi-statement transactions on a single shard basis.
