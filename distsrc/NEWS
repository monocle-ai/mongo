tokuds 0.2.0
------------
Release date: TBD

General
~~~~~~~

    - The major development in this release is the addition of sharding.


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Sharding is now supported for evaluation.

    - Sharding on a hashed key is supported (backported from 2.4).

    - Sharding creates clustering indexes by default, which is a
      significant performance advantage in most cases.  If you need to
      shard on a non-clustering index, you need to specify that in
      sh.shardCollection(), for example

          sh.shardCollection("test.foo",
                             {x: 1},
                             false, // unique
                             false   // clustering
                             );

    - The JS client driver now supports the clustering flag in
      sh.shardCollection, which should only be used if you want to specify
      that you want to shard on a NON-clustering index (set it to false).
      See above.

    - "DDL" changes (create, drop, ensureIndex, dropIndexes, rename) are
      now supported inside multi-statement transactions, and are properly
      rolled back on rollbackTransaction, with the exception of rename
      across databases.

    - The C++ client driver now supports clustering indexes.  This changes
      the function signature for DBClientWithCommands::ensureIndex, please
      check your applications in light of this API change.

    - The C++ client driver has a convenience class for multi-statement
      transactions: RemoteTransaction.  Please check its documentation.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Multi-statement transactions are not supported in a sharded cluster,
      and will be rejected by mongos.


tokuds 0.1.0
------------
Release date: 2013-04-15

General
~~~~~~~

    - This release highlights single-threaded and multi-threaded
      performance improvements.


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Concurrency: inserts, updates, and deletes into existing collections
      are now concurrent operations, with each other and with read
      operations. (trac #6019)

    - Multi-statement transactions: clients may now issue
      `beginTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, and `rollbackTransaction`
      commands using the `runCommand` interface, to bundle multiple
      individual statements together in the same system transaction.

    - The key format used in vanilla MongoDB's `{v:1}` indexes is now used
      in the Fractal Tree storage system.  This yields significant
      performance gains, particularly for in-memory workloads.

    - Capped collections and tailable cursors are now supported for
      experimental use only.

    - The `renameCollection` command is now supported.

    - The system allocator has been changed fully to jemalloc.

New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - The gcc and stdc++ runtime libraries are now packaged with the
      binaries to fix runtime issues on older Centos 5 machines. (trac
      #6456)
