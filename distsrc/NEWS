tokumon 0.1.0
-------------
Release date: 2013-04-15

General
~~~~~~~

    - This release highlights single-threaded and multi-threaded
      performance improvements.


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Concurrency: inserts, updates, and deletes into existing collections
      are now concurrent operations, with each other and with read
      operations. (trac #6019)

    - Multi-statement transactions: clients may now issue
      `beginTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, and `rollbackTransaction`
      commands using the `runCommand` interface, to bundle multiple
      individual statements together in the same system transaction.

    - The key format used in vanilla MongoDB's `{v:1}` indexes is now used
      in the Fractal Tree storage system.  This yields significant
      performance gains, particularly for in-memory workloads.

    - Capped collections and tailable cursors are now supported for
      experimental use only.

    - The `renameCollection` command is now supported.

    - The system allocator has been changed fully to jemalloc.
