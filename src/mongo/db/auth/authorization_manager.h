     * authzUpdateLock is the lock that serializes all writes to the persistent authorization
     * documents (admin.system.users, admin.system.roles, admin.system.version).
     * When the guard is constructed it initially locks the AM::_lock.  The guard's destructor will
     * always release the AM::_lock if it is held.
     * The guard then provides some public methods that allow interaction with the
     * AuthorizationManager while inside the AM::_lock.
     * If modifications to the authorization documents in persistent storage is required, then
     * consumers of the guard can call tryAcquireAuthzUpdateLock() to lock the authzUpdateLock.

     * held the whole time (which prevents authentication and access control

     * be held, if the guard's destructor is called when the authzUpdateLock is held but the
     * AM::_lock is not, it will first acquire the AM::_lock, then release the authzUpdateLock,
     * then finally release the AM::_lock.
     *
